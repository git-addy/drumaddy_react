              <span>Drumming and Fitness</span>
              <p>
                I think everyone agrees with the fact that drumming requires a certain amount of physical fitness. <br /><br />

                So I decided to put this thought into action and see the results for myself. The next thing was which exercises should I include in my workout that directly compliment my drumming. The answer is a bit complex since we use all our limbs to play!! So in the spirit of getting better, I have dedicated this page to exercises both in general and essential warmups before you start playing.<br /><br />
                Just to get you motivated I want to mention that the results are positive and my own drumming improved a lot since! So its an affirmative!<br /><br />
                WHAT CHANGED FOR ME:

                <ul className="xbenefits">
                  <li>Better stamina overall</li>
                  <li>Faster rolls and a smoother flow while  playing fills </li>
                  <li>More dynamic control</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                A small word of advice before you jump into the exercises: You will notice an almost immediate effect on your drumming right after but donâ€™t stop there! Continual exercise will give you control, speed and agility in the long term. And the effort that you put in, as you will yourself notice, is totally worth it!
